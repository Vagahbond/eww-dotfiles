# Vagahbar

This is the eww bar configuration I made the rice I use on my daily driver. 

It currently runs on NixOS but this configuration is made so that it can be used on any type of setup. 

## Installation

1) Clone this repos in `~/.config/eww`
2) If you want to use other widgets alognside this bar, you can just paste the content of `eww.yuck` in yours, and it should import the files correctly. Same applies for the scss file.

### Adaptive bar
The bar adapts to windows taking the screen's whole space. It creates gaps with the border whenever sever windows are tiled on the screen.

### Colors
